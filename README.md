# A CIRCUS Ran by Snakes[^1]
Also known as Connorâ€™s In-tents Random Chance Understanding Software, created for the Games Day Project in MDM4U1-04.


This program was used to experimentally test and determine values such as the total tickets lost by the player, the expected for the game, and the ticket loss per million simulations. It also included easy ways to modify values, such as the quantity of each color duck, the payout for each type of reward, and what type of rewards are present.


Please excuse the poorly written code, it was done quickly.



[^1]: A joke, since the name of the program is CIRCUS, and it was written in the coding language Python, which is also a type of snake.
